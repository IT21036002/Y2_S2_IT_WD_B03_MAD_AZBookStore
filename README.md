Introduction:
AZ Bookstore is an app designed for book lovers of all genres. You can find fiction to nonfiction to even student texts books.  You can get books from our app in two ways. You can buy any book from our app, and it gets added to the cart. You can customize your order quantity before you proceed to pay. You can pay using all visa master cards.If you are a student on budget, we have the option of renting a book. This is where you will mostly find texts books, needed especially for university students, which would cost a lot. With this feature you can rent a book for half the price for a week. Depending on how long you want the book price may vary. You can simply rent the book by giving your details. Once the payment is completed, we will deliver the book to your doorstep. If the book is rented, we will come and pick it up once your reading dates expires.
